Planning Poker — Internal Team Tool
A simple browser-based planning poker tool for agile estimation sessions.
What it does
The team opens a shared room in the browser, uploads a task list exported from Jira as CSV, and runs a planning poker session together. Each participant votes on the effort of each task using Fibonacci cards. Votes are hidden until the moderator reveals them all at once. After discussion, the team moves to the next task.
Key constraints

No registration or login
No data is saved — everything exists only during the session
Works in any modern browser
One command to start the server

Who uses it
A small agile team: one moderator (Scrum Master or team lead) who controls the session, and players who vote. The moderator imports tasks, controls reveal and moves between issues. Players just vote.
Out of scope
No Jira API integration, no session history, no mobile app.
